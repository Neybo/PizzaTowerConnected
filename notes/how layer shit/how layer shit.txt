Assets_FG = 89
Assets_FG_FG = -100
Tiles_ + number (higher = higher layer)
Tiles_BG + number (etc.) just further away by a lot
Tiles_Foreground + number (etc) it is close by one and the number thing
Assets_BG = 289
Backgrounds_FG = -100
Assets_L + number (etc.etc.etc.etcc.) the l is there cuz some assets layers shouldnt have the game layer sys

remember the lower the number
the higher it is
(think of it like camera distance)
however the number that you put in the layer name is inverse
