# Pizza Tower Connected

A mod of PTO, that due to copyright law (under the GPLv3 license that PTO ***had*** when we forked it) the source code has to go public.

However, I don't think you can make public mods of PTC due to the fact that loypoll has ***now*** removed the license to make it all rights reserved, and has explictly denied all future modifications of it.

Certain parts of the code are removed to prevent compromise of the servers, and of encryption standards.

I hope you enjoy this source code, which includes the PTCUtils.dll source code, the FMOD project and the *y'know* game.

Open with 2023.6.0.139 (runtime).

This is a seperate repo to prevent compromise of servers blah blah.
